    <h1>Payment & Billing Policy</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Monthly Payments</h2>
        <p>All VPS services are billed on a monthly basis. Customers are required to pay the standard monthly price according to the selected plan. Payments must be made on or before the renewal date to ensure uninterrupted service.</p>
        <p>Example pricing:</p>
        <table class="table">
            <tr>
                <th>Plan</th>
                <th>Monthly Price</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>VPS G1</td>
                <td>$6.64</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>VPS G 3 </td>
                <td>$15.00</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Activation & Reactivation Fees</h2>
        <p>An <span class="highlight">activation fee</span> applies when creating a new VPS. If a service is suspended due to overdue payments, a <span class="highlight">reactivation fee</span> may be applied to resume service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Activation fees are a one-time payment per new service.</li>
            <li>Reactivation fees are only charged when resuming a suspended service.</li>
            <li>Paying before the renewal date avoids additional fees.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Taxes</h2>
        <p>Applicable taxes, such as VAT, will be applied to all invoices where required by law. Taxes are calculated based on the total amount of the service plus any applicable fees.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <table class="table">
            <tr>
                <th>Service</th>
                <th>Price</th>
                <th>VAT (10%)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>VPS G 1</td>
                <td>$6.64</td>
                <td>$0.56</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Activation Fee</td>
                <td>$2.50</td>
                <td>$0.25</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Billing Period</h2>
        <p>Each invoice covers a one-month billing period. The period starts on the service activation date or the renewal date for ongoing services.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Invoices are generated automatically before the start of the next billing period.</li>
            <li>Customers are responsible for ensuring timely payment to avoid service interruption.</li>
            <li>Any unpaid invoices after the due date may incur suspension and reactivation fees.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Service Cancellation & Refunds</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cancellation requests must be submitted before the renewal date to avoid charges for the next billing period.</li>
            <li>No refunds are issued for partial months unless specified.</li>
            <li>Cancelled services billed due to invoice generation prior to cancellation may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.</li>
            <li>Once a service is cancelled, access to the VPS and its data will be terminated at the end of the current billing period.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Late Payment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Invoices must be paid by the due date to avoid service suspension.</li>
            <li>Suspended services may require reactivation fees to resume.</li>
            <li>Repeated late payments may result in termination of account or services.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Terms & Conditions</h2>
        <p>By using our VPS services, you agree to the terms outlined in this billing policy. These policies may be updated periodically, and customers are responsible for reviewing the latest version.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All payments are non-transferable and non-refundable unless specified.</li>
            <li>Any disputes regarding billing must be submitted within 7 days of invoice issuance.</li>
            <li>The company reserves the right to modify fees, taxes, and billing procedures with prior notice.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Always ensure your payment method is active and up-to-date to avoid unexpected suspension or fees. Your understanding of this billing policy ensures smooth service continuity.
